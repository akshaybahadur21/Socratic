- Latency: 3-4 seconds (GPT-4o)
- Support: Images, LateX, Markdown
- Interface: Streamlit



## Python  Implementation 👨‍🔬

1) Network Used- Convolutional Neural Network
2) Hand Tracking - Mediapipe

If you face any problem, kindly raise an issue

## Setup 🖥️

1) Add your mathematics symbol trained model in the `models` folder
2) Run `Socratic.py -option <plot or equation>`
3) Demonstrate anywhere on the screen
4) Write your equation in the green box for the machine learning model to solve it.

## Execution 🐉

- For running Socratic in Python IDE
```
python3 Socratic.py -option <plot or equation>
```
